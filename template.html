      <ul>
        <li>Not a lot is needed to make the developer life setup way better. We can only focus on the setup experience this cycle.</li>

            <li>Installing the openjdk vm and setup it up by default.</li>
            <li>Setting up the needed quirks if on 64bits</li>
            <li>Add a launcher icon and try to setup sdk/vms pre-launchers.</li>
            <li>Upgrade mecanism and first setup download with SDK download is let to the great auto-update from those tools.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>It can be a simple command line tool, with a GUI if needed, letting you choose between options.</li>
        <li>Can be easily extended to include other platforms, like <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">dart</a>… maybe <a href="https://unity3d.com/">unity3d</a>…</li>

        <li>There is a license agreement that the user needs to acknowledge. It can be easily downloaded through the page.

Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
not: (a) copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, <b>redistribute</b>,
decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative work of the SDK or
any part of the SDK;</pre>

          <li>Examples in videos aren't really practicle: it's all about mediawiki!</li>
          <li>For instance, bundle isn't integrated to juju at all (juju-quickstart is using juju-gui backend service which is talking to juju-deployer. juju-local isn't installed by default.</li>
          <li>juju-local and juju-quickstart are stalling in pure trusty. No clear SRU policy despite the fix being there for 2 months now.</li>
          <li>Local charm store is possible, but not flexible instance, bundle isn't integrated to juju at all and can't be local.</li>
